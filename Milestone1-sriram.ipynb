    "### **Example Problem Statement: Fuel-Efficient Car Usage**\n",
    "*Fuel efficiency is a major factor in reducing carbon emissions and lowering fuel costs. Drivers often adopt inefficient driving patterns, wasting fuel through unnecessary acceleration, braking, or idling. A deep learning model could analyze driving behavior and suggest optimizations in real-time, helping individuals improve their fuel economy.*\n",

    "### **Lane Line Detection**\n",
    "Lane line detection is a crucial aspect of most autonomous driving systems. It involves identifying and tracking the lane markings on the road to ensure the vehicle stays within its designated lane. Accurate lane detection is essential for maintaining safe driving conditions, enabling features like lane-keeping assistance, adaptive cruise control, and autonomous navigation. However, challenges such as varying lighting conditions, occlusions (e.g., by other vehicles or debris), and poorly marked or faded lane lines can make this task complex. A deep learning model trained on annotated road images can be used to detect lane lines in real-time, providing the vehicle with the necessary information to make informed decisions and navigate safely. By improving the robustness and accuracy of lane detection systems, we can enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, ultimately contributing to safer roads and more efficient transportation systems."
